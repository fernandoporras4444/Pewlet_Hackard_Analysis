# Pewlet Hackard Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose for this analysis was help determine and identify the number of employees retiring by position title, and also identify employees who are eligible for participating in the company's mentorship program.

## Results:
Based on the company's data from varies csv files imported into Postgres11 Database, I was able to build Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) which would allow import data tables to join on identified Primary Key(s) and Foregin Key(s) improving the abilities of writing Structured Query Language (SQL) query statements for further analysis.
